## About CUBO+

**CUBO+** is a residential fellowship in El Salvador that brings together the best young talent from the region to learn, build, and grow within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Throughout the program, participants develop real projects, collaborate with world-class mentors, and become part of a global network of builders.

### What we do

Each cohort explores three dimensions of the ecosystem:

- **Technical**: Bitcoin and Lightning Network development, open-source tooling.
- **Product**: UX design, product strategy, agile methodologies.
- **Content & Community**: Technical communication, storytelling, audience building.

### The mission

Build the Bitcoin talent of the next cycle. We believe the most powerful ideas in the digital world are born when talented people have the right environment, tools, and community.

### Cohort 2026
